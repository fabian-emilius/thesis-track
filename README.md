# ThesisTrack

ThesisTrack is a web-based thesis management system designed to streamline the thesis process in academic institutions by integrating essential stages into a single platform. 
Developed to address challenges in managing large volumes of theses, it facilitates seamless interactions between students, advisors, and supervisors. 
Key features include a centralized application process, guided workflows for thesis writing, automated notifications, and a comprehensive Gantt chart for tracking progress. 
By consolidating communication, feedback, and file management, ThesisTrack enhances transparency, reduces administrative burdens, and fosters efficient thesis supervision and assessment.

ThesisTrack was developed as part of this [bachelor's thesis](docs/files/ba-thesis-fabian-emilius.pdf).
