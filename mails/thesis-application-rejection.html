<p>Dear {{student.firstName}},</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in pursuing your thesis under my supervision. I have carefully reviewed your application and supporting documents. It is with regret that I inform you that I am unable to accommodate your request to supervise your thesis. The volume of applications received this year was exceptionally high, and I have limited capacity to ensure each student receives the appropriate level of support and guidance. I recommend reaching out to other faculty members who specialize in your area of interest.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
    Stephan
