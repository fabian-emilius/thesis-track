<p>Dear {{recipientName}},</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your interest in pursuing your thesis under my supervision.
  I have carefully reviewed your application and supporting documents.
  Unfortunately, I must inform you that you do not currently meet the necessary requirements for thesis supervision under my guidance.
