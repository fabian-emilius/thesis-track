<p>Dear {{recipientName}},</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your interest in pursuing your thesis under my supervision.
  I have carefully reviewed your application and supporting documents.
  It is with regret that I inform you that I am unable to supervise your thesis.
  The volume of applications received this year was exceptionally high, and I have limited capacity to ensure each student receives the appropriate level of support and guidance.
</p>
<p>
  I recommend reaching out to other faculty members who may align more closely with your qualifications and area of interest.
