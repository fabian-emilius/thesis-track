<p>Dear {{recipientName}},</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your interest in pursuing your thesis under my supervision.
    I have carefully reviewed your application and supporting documents.
    It is with regret that I inform you that I am unable to accommodate your request to supervise your thesis.
    The volume of applications received this year was exceptionally high, and I have limited capacity to ensure each student receives the appropriate level of support and guidance.
    I recommend reaching out to other faculty members who specialize in your area of interest.
